Developer Notes
---------------

This is the first game in the series. The game is extremely simple, and barely has any challenge, but it demonstrates all parts of the game loop. It's possible for the player to lose (though it's difficult), and there's an incentive for the player to collect money. Thus, in the strictest sense, this is a game.

Special thanks to [Kenny.nl](http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-tiles) for providing the crate and player graphics.
